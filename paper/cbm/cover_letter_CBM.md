# Cover Letter (CBM)

Dear Editor-in-Chief,

Please consider our manuscript **"ECG Heartbeat Classification under AAMI Mapping using a CNN+Conformer with Wavelet Scalograms: A Reproducible Pipeline"** for publication in *Computers in Biology and Medicine*.

**Contribution and scope** — We present a compact, reproducible ECG pipeline (Morlet CWT scalograms + CNN+Conformer) evaluated under the AAMI five-class taxonomy on MIT–BIH. All tables/figures are produced strictly from repository artifacts (pinned commit), including derived analyses (leaderboard, per-class comparisons).

**Relevance to CBM** — The manuscript aligns with CBM’s focus on computational methods with biomedical impact, emphasizing transparent evaluation and reproducibility.

**Ethics/competing interests** — The study uses public PhysioNet data; all authors approve the submission and report no conflicts.

Sincerely,

Alireza Abbaszadeh (corresponding author)\\nDepartment of Computer Engineering, Ma.C., Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran\\nEmail: alireza.abbaszadeh.research@gmail.com
