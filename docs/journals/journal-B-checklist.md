# BioMedical Engineering OnLine submission checklist

## Scope alignment
- Ensure the study contributes to biomedical engineering using physical, data, or engineering approaches and does not rely solely on simulations, public datasets, healthy controls, or preliminary design-only results.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L35-L104】

## Article type & length
- Prepare Research Articles with Background, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions, and Declarations subsections; abstract ≤350 words with Background/Results/Conclusions, and 3–10 keywords.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-research.md†L10-L91】
- Include structured Declarations covering ethics approval, consent, data availability, competing interests, funding, authors’ contributions, acknowledgements, and optional author information; mark non-applicable items explicitly.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-research.md†L76-L175】
- Provide list of abbreviations if needed and ensure footnotes follow journal rules.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-research.md†L72-L188】

## Manuscript formatting & submission files
- Use double-line spacing, line and page numbers, SI units, and avoid manual page breaks; submit editable DOC/DOCX, RTF, or LaTeX source (with Springer Nature template recommended).【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L195-L218】
- Upload all editable source files during submission and maintain machine-readable data where possible.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L220-L254】
- Confirm cover letter includes rationale for the journal, policy compliance, competing interests, author approvals, exclusivity statement, and any special issue reference.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L414-L424】

## Figures, tables, and supplementary content
- Number figures in order, combine multi-panel figures, keep titles ≤15 words and legends ≤300 words, limit files to ≤10 MB, and meet 600/1200 px web and 85/170 mm PDF dimensions at ~300 dpi.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L285-L333】
- Supply acceptable figure formats (EPS, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, CDX) and compress without quality loss.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L298-L338】
- Format tables with numbered citations, 15-word titles, ≤300-word legends, no color/shading, and submit as table objects or supplementary spreadsheets where necessary.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L340-L353】
- Provide supplementary files ≤20 MB each with descriptive metadata and cite them sequentially in the manuscript.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L356-L373】

## References & citation practice
- Cite only published/in-press items or accessible preprints; assign reference numbers to URLs and include access dates.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L263-L281】
- Follow Vancouver-style examples supplied by the journal, including dataset DOIs when applicable.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-research.md†L190-L200】

## Data, code, and materials
- Deposit underlying datasets in community repositories when possible, reference persistent identifiers, and include a compliant data availability statement using the provided templates.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-research.md†L14-L142】
- Encourage sharing of source code under an open-source license and supply supplementary archives plus project homepage links when releasing software.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-research.md†L12-L17】

## Ethical and policy compliance
- Address ethics approvals, consent, AI tool usage, and competing interests within the Declarations; follow Springer Nature editorial policies for reporting standards.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-research.md†L76-L158】
- Monitor APC guidance and forthcoming year pricing via Springer Nature journal lists when budgeting (current APC £1990 / $2690 / €2290).【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L129-L140】

## Submission logistics
- Gather full author contact details, ORCID iDs, peer reviewer suggestions/exclusions, and confirm team approval before submission.【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L414-L424】
- After acceptance, follow Springer guidance for promoting the publication and ensure compliance with open-access licensing (CC BY or CC BY-NC-ND).【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L164-L174】【F:docs/journals/biomedical-engineering-online-springer-guidelines.md†L31-L33】
