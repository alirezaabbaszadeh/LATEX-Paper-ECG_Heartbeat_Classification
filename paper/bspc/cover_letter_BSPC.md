# Cover Letter (BSPC) — refined

Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We submit **"Reproducible ECG Heartbeat Classification under AAMI Five-Class Taxonomy using a Compact CNN+Conformer with Wavelet Scalograms"** to *Biomedical Signal Processing and Control*.

**Why BSPC** — The manuscript squarely targets biomedical signal processing of ECG. The method is concise (Morlet CWT scalograms + compact CNN+Conformer), with careful evaluation under the AAMI five-class taxonomy.

**What is new** — (i) A lightweight Conformer classifier on wavelet scalograms; (ii) an artifact-driven evaluation where all tables/figures are built from repository outputs; and (iii) a fully reproducible pack pinned to commit `384b316cf65a47b9d66035e5a868f970e89525dc`.

**Impact** — The pipeline is transparent and deployable, addressing class imbalance (macro-F1, PR/ROC) and enabling exact replication for clinical and embedded use.

The work is original, not under review elsewhere, and all authors approve. We declare no competing interests.

Sincerely,

Alireza Abbaszadeh (corresponding author)\\nDepartment of Computer Engineering, Ma.C., Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran\\nEmail: alireza.abbaszadeh.research@gmail.com
