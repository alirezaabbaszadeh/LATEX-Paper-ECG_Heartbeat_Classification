\section{Conclusion}
We presented a double-stage waveform analysis pipeline that fuses Morlet scalograms with a lightweight Conformer to deliver interpretable arrhythmia classification on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The approach advanced macro-averaged discrimination, tightened calibration, and reduced alert fatigue relative to strong neural baselines, satisfying operational constraints articulated in recent AI-enabled ECG deployments.\cite{Hsieh2025Economic,Hempel2025ECGAging,Gliner2025Interpretability} Through explicit attention visualization and calibrated probability estimates, the system provides clinicians with human-readable evidence that complements existing telecardiology workflows.

The reproducibility-first design, including shared preprocessing scripts, training code, and calibrated weights, aligns with open-access best practices and extends BioMedical Engineering OnLine efforts to couple interpretable modeling with resilient sensing pipelines across diverse physiological domains.\cite{Jiang2025Hybrid,Stern2024InBed,Aslan2025Poincare} Looking forward, expanding the dataset with federated contributions, incorporating uncertainty-aware active learning, and prospectively validating the tool in multi-center telemonitoring programs will further bridge the gap between experimental performance and routine cardiovascular care.
