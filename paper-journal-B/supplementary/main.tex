\section{Additional files for upload}
The following artifacts will be uploaded to BMC's supplementary files portal (each \(\leq\)20~MB) and correspond to results reported in the main text. Filenames match those committed in this repository for traceability.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Additional file 1: Classification report (CSV): \texttt{paper-journal-B/tables/classification_report.csv}
  \item Additional file 2: AUC by class (CSV): \texttt{paper-journal-B/tables/auc_by_class.csv}
  \item Additional file 3: K-fold accuracies (CSV): \texttt{paper-journal-B/tables/kfold_accuracy.csv}
  \item Additional file 4: Training history (JSON): \texttt{Research_Runs/final_run_Main_Model_20250824_154136/final_model_training_history.json}
  \item Additional file 5: Raw predictions (NumPy NPZ): \texttt{Research_Runs/final_run_Main_Model_20250824_154136/raw_predictions.npz}
  \item Additional file 6: Full classification report (TXT): \texttt{Research_Runs/final_run_Main_Model_20250824_154136/classification_report.txt}
  \item Additional file 7: Final model weights (Keras): \texttt{Research_Runs/final_run_Main_Model_20250824_154136/final_model_Main_Model.keras}
\end{itemize}
