The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board reviewed this project (HUM00234718) and determined that it does not constitute human subjects research because it uses only publicly available, fully de-identified recordings distributed by PhysioNet. No additional patient contact or data collection occurred, and informed consent was therefore not required.
