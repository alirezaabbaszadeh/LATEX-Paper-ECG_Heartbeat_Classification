Journal of Electrocardiology (Elsevier)
Scope

Focuses on clinical and experimental studies of the heart’s electrical activity, including electrocardiography, vectorcardiography, arrhythmias, pacing, instrumentation, and related computational applications.

Guide for Authors

Core article types and limits: Original Research (≤5,000 words, ≤40 references), Reviews (10–15 double-spaced pages including figures/tables, ≤3 illustrations, ≤40 references), Technical articles (10–15 double-spaced pages, ≤25 references), Case Reports (3–5 pages, ≤8 references, 100-word abstract), and other short formats with explicit word/figure caps.

Required structure guidance: manuscripts must be divided into clearly defined sections with headings; acknowledgements precede references; footnotes numbered consecutively.

Formatting essentials: provide editable source files (Word single column or LaTeX), include a structured or unstructured abstract ≤250 words, supply 1–7 keywords, and submit 3–5 bullet-point highlights plus (optional) graphical abstract meeting minimum dimensions.

Citation style: numerical in-text citations in square brackets ordered by appearance, abbreviated journal names per LTWA, shortened page ranges, and dataset/software citation formats.

Figures/tables: submit images separately, supply captions, meet minimum dpi (e.g., ≥300 dpi for halftones, ≥1000 dpi for line art), and limit Review articles to three illustrations; tables must be editable text.

Data sharing: encouraged to deposit data in repositories, cite datasets, and include a data availability statement (Elsevier “Option B”).

2026 policy check

Elsevier’s policy hub lists current standards (accessibility, research data, generative AI, etc.) but no forthcoming 2026-specific style or data-sharing changes.

Latest newsroom posts (as of Sept 2025) also show no 2026 policy announcements.

References and supporting files: cite only published or in-press works; web links assigned reference numbers; tables formatted via word processor table tools; additional files allowed (≤20 MB) with explicit metadata and repository preference for datasets.

Data & materials: strongly encourage depositing datasets in repositories and detailing availability statements; follow FORCE11 principles and include repository identifiers/DOIs.

Editorial policies: extensive requirements for ethics, consent, data availability, AI use, reporting standards, and competing interests apply to all submissions.

2026 policy check

The “2026 APCs” notice directs authors to Springer Nature journal lists for next-year charges but no new 2026 data/code-sharing or ethics changes are announced.

No additional 2026 policy updates surfaced beyond standing editorial policies outlined above.
