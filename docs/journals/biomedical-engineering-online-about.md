Aims and scope
--------------

_BioMedical Engineering OnLine_ is an open access, peer-reviewed journal that is dedicated to publishing research in all areas of biomedical engineering.

_BioMedical Engineering OnLine_ is aimed at readers and authors throughout the world, with an interest in using tools of the physical and data sciences and techniques in engineering to understand and solve problems in the biological and medical sciences. 

 BioMedical Engineering OnLine does not consider papers that contain only simulation data (no real patient data), that work with only publicly available data (e.g. Physionet, TCGA), studies containing health controls, and preliminary design results.

Topical areas include, but are not limited to:

Bioinformatics 

 Bioinstrumentation 

 Biomechanics 

 Biomedical Devices & Instrumentation 

 Biomedical Signal Processing 

 Healthcare Information Systems 

 Human Dynamics 

 Neural Engineering 

 Rehabilitation Engineering 

 Biomaterials 

 Biomedical Imaging & Image Processing 

 BioMEMS and On-Chip Devices 

 Bio-Micro/Nano Technologies 

 Biomolecular Engineering 

 Biosensors 

 Cardiovascular Systems Engineering 

 Cellular Engineering 

 Clinical Engineering 

 Computational Biology 

 Drug Delivery Technologies 

 Modeling Methodologies 

 Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology in Biomedicine 

 Respiratory Systems Engineering 

 Robotics in Medicine 

 Systems and Synthetic Biology 

 Systems Biology 

 Telemedicine/Smartphone Applications in Medicine 

 Therapeutic Systems, Devices and Technologies 

 Tissue Engineering

This publication promotes the rapid and free accessibility of articles for biomedical engineering researchers everywhere, who are linked together by their various research interests and their values in promoting benefits to all of humanity.

Peer-review policy
------------------

Peer-review is the system used to assess the quality of a manuscript before it is published. Independent researchers in the relevant research area assess submitted manuscripts for originality, validity and significance to help editors determine whether the manuscript should be published in their journal. You can read more about the peer-review process [here](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/peer-review-process).

_BioMedical Engineering Online_ operates a single-blind peer-review system, where the reviewers are aware of the names and affiliations of the authors, but the reviewer reports provided to authors are anonymous.

The benefit of single-blind peer review is that it is the traditional model of peer review that many reviewers are comfortable with, and it facilitates a dispassionate critique of a manuscript.

Submitted manuscripts will generally be reviewed by two or more experts who will be asked to evaluate whether the manuscript is scientifically sound and coherent, whether it duplicates already published work, and whether or not the manuscript is sufficiently clear for publication. The Editors will reach a decision based on these reports and, where necessary, they will consult with members of the[Editorial Board](http://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board).

Editorial policies
------------------

All manuscripts submitted to _BioMedical Engineering OnLine_ should adhere to [BioMed Central's editorial policies](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies).

Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.

Citing articles in _BioMedical Engineering OnLine_
--------------------------------------------------

Articles in _BioMedical Engineering OnLine_ should be cited in the same way as articles in a traditional journal. Because articles are not printed, they do not have page numbers; instead, they are given a unique article number.

Article citations follow this format:

Authors: Title. _BioMed Eng OnLine_ [year], [volume number]:[article number].

e.g. Roberts LD, Hassall DG, Winegar DA, Haselden JN, Nicholls AW, Griffin JL: Increased hepatic oxidative metabolism distinguishes the action of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor delta from Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma in the Ob/Ob mouse. _BioMed Eng OnLine_ 2009, **1**:115.

refers to article 115 from Volume 1 of the journal.

Appeals and complaints
----------------------

Authors who wish to appeal a rejection or make a complaint should follow the procedure outlined in the [BMC Editorial Policies](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#appeals+and+complaints)[.](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#appeals+and+complaints)
