\section{Conclusion}
We presented a reproducible ECG heartbeat classification pipeline that combines Morlet wavelet scalograms with a lightweight Conformer encoder. Leveraging the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, the approach delivered substantial improvements over attention-only, CNN-LSTM, and feature-engineered baselines while providing comprehensive diagnostics for downstream clinical assessment. Although performance on rare fusion beats remains limited, the reported gains and open-source tooling offer a practical foundation for telemonitoring decision support. Future extensions that expand datasets, enrich contextual modelling, and incorporate clinician feedback loops are expected to further advance robust, deployable arrhythmia screening.
