# Cover Letter (CBM) — refined

Dear Editor-in-Chief,

Please consider **"ECG Heartbeat Classification under AAMI Mapping using a CNN+Conformer with Wavelet Scalograms: A Reproducible Pipeline"** for *Computers in Biology and Medicine*.

**Fit to CBM** — The paper presents a computational pipeline with biomedical relevance: a compact time–frequency front-end (Morlet CWT) with an attention-based classifier (CNN+Conformer) for AAMI five-class ECG classification.

**Reproducibility** — All figures/tables are built from repository artifacts, pinned to commit `384b316cf65a47b9d66035e5a868f970e89525dc`, requiring no retraining.

**Significance** — The artifact-first evaluation and imbalance-aware metrics provide a transparent baseline that can be integrated into clinical research workflows and resource-constrained deployments.

All authors approve; the work is original and we report no conflicts.

Sincerely,

Alireza Abbaszadeh (corresponding author)\\nDepartment of Computer Engineering, Ma.C., Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran\\nEmail: alireza.abbaszadeh.research@gmail.com
