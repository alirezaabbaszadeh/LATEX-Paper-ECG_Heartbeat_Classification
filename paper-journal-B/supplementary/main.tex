\section{Supplementary tables}
\label{sec:supp-tables}
Table~\ref{tab:supp-kfold-acc} reports the loss and accuracy achieved on each fold of the Conformer five-fold procedure; the underlying CSV is submitted as Additional file~3 and also stored in \texttt{paper-journal-B/tables/kfold_accuracy.csv}. The per-class AUROC values plotted in \autoref{fig:roc-curves} appear in Table~\ref{tab:auc-by-class}, whose source CSV corresponds to Additional file~2.

\section{Additional files submitted to BMC}
The files listed below will be uploaded to the BMC supplementary material portal (each \( \leq \)20~MB) and match the repository paths for traceability. They provide the detailed CSVs, logs, and weights needed to reproduce the figures and tables referenced in \autoref{sec:results} and \autoref{sec:supp-tables}.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Additional file 1: Classification report (CSV) — \texttt{paper-journal-B/tables/classification_report.csv}. Includes per-class precision, recall, F1, and support for the held-out test cohort and underpins the metrics listed in Table~\ref{tab:per-class}.
  \item Additional file 2: AUC by class (CSV) — \texttt{paper-journal-B/tables/auc_by_class.csv}. Records the class-specific AUROC values highlighted in \autoref{fig:roc-curves} and Table~\ref{tab:auc-by-class}.
  \item Additional file 3: K-fold accuracies (CSV) — \texttt{paper-journal-B/tables/kfold_accuracy.csv}. Mirrors the statistics reported in Table~\ref{tab:supp-kfold-acc} for the five-fold evaluation.
  \item Additional file 4: Training history (JSON) — \texttt{Research_Runs/final_run_Main_Model_20250824_154136/final_model_training_history.json}. Logs epoch-level losses and metrics for the final Conformer model before calibration.
  \item Additional file 5: Raw predictions (NumPy NPZ) — \texttt{Research_Runs/final_run_Main_Model_20250824_154136/raw_predictions.npz}. Provides the true labels, softmax probabilities, and discrete predictions used to generate the ROC, precision--recall, and confusion matrix figures.
  \item Additional file 6: Full classification report (TXT) — \texttt{Research_Runs/final_run_Main_Model_20250824_154136/classification_report.txt}. Documents the textual report that appears in the repository logs and verifies the CSV summary.
  \item Additional file 7: Final model weights (Keras) — \texttt{Research_Runs/final_run_Main_Model_20250824_154136/final_model_Main_Model.keras}. Enables loading the calibrated Conformer for deployment or further analysis.

\section{Reporting checklists}
No human participants, data, or tissues were involved in this study; we relied solely on publicly available, de-identified ECG records (MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database) and open-source code. Consequently, CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA checklists, IRB approval, and consent to participate are not applicable.
