# Journal of Electrocardiology submission checklist

## Scope alignment
- Confirm the manuscript addresses clinical or experimental research on cardiac electrical activity, including electrocardiography, vectorcardiography, arrhythmias, pacing, monitoring, instrumentation, drug effects, or related computational work.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L8-L12】

## Article type & length
- Select the correct article category and respect limits: Original Research ≤5,000 words and ≤40 references; Reviews 10–15 double-spaced pages with ≤3 illustrations and ≤40 references; Technical articles 10–15 double-spaced pages with ≤25 references; Case Reports/Short Communications 3–5 pages with ≤8 references and 100-word abstract; other invited formats follow stated caps.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L20-L40】

## Manuscript structure & front matter
- Use clearly defined section headings and place acknowledgements immediately before the references.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L544-L558】
- Provide a ≤250-word abstract (structured when appropriate), list 1–7 keywords, and upload highlights (3–5 bullets, ≤85 characters) as a separate file.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L290-L328】
- Include a detailed title page with author affiliations, corresponding author contact, and any present addresses; ensure SI units throughout.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L276-L348】
- If submitting a graphical abstract, meet the minimum 531 × 1328 px requirement and approved file types.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L330-L342】

## Formatting & file preparation
- Supply editable source files (.doc/.docx or .tex); Word submissions must remain single-column, with strikethrough/underlining removed.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L262-L272】
- Follow Elsevier spelling/grammar expectations and declare any use of generative AI tools in a dedicated section before the references.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L290-L318】【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L428-L434】【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L178-L190】
- Use SI units and provide math in editable form; number equations consecutively.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L344-L360】

## Tables, figures, and supplementary items
- Submit tables as editable text with captions and notes, numbered in order of appearance and avoiding vertical rules.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L362-L378】
- Upload each figure as a separate file, cite in order, include captions, and meet resolution thresholds: ≥300 dpi halftones, ≥1000 dpi line art, ≥500 dpi mixed graphics.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L380-L408】
- Provide captions in a separate file and ensure any color artwork is accessible; do not use generative AI to create or alter images unless part of the research methods and fully disclosed.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L414-L434】
- Cite and describe all supplementary materials, keeping file versions synchronized throughout review.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L436-L452】

## References & citations
- Use Vancouver numbering with square brackets in order of appearance, abbreviate journal titles per LTWA, and include DOIs where available.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L618-L676】
- Ensure references cited in the abstract are given in full and that unpublished data are handled within the text only.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L620-L634】

## Compliance statements & disclosures
- Provide comprehensive declarations for funding, competing interests, and generative AI usage; upload the Elsevier declarations form when required.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L134-L170】【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L178-L190】
- Include CRediT author contribution statements and separate acknowledgements before the reference list.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L556-L566】

## Data & co-submission options
- Follow Option B data policy: deposit data in repositories when possible, cite datasets, and add a data availability statement.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L436-L454】
- Consider co-submission to Data in Brief or MethodsX using their mandatory templates when sharing datasets or protocols.【F:docs/journals/journal-of-electrocardiology-guide.md†L520-L538】
