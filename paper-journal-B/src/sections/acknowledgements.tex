We are grateful to Dr. Emily B. Carlson for clinical feedback on arrhythmia interpretation and to the Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care for providing access to their high-performance computing cluster. We also thank the PhysioNet resource team for maintaining the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the University of Michigan Library Research Data Services for advising on long-term curation of the derived datasets.
