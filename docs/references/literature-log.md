# Literature Search Log

## 2024-05-07 Search Session
- **Objective:** Identify foundational ECG heartbeat classification references covering datasets and deep learning methodology for manuscript sections (Datasets, Methods).
- **Databases & Tools:** Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore.
- **Search Queries:**
  - `"ECG heartbeat classification" PhysioNet dataset`
  - `"deep neural network" arrhythmia detection ambulatory ECG Nature Medicine`
  - `"ECG" "transferable representation" ICASSP 2018`
- **Selection Rules:**
  1. Peer-reviewed journal or flagship conference publications after 2000.
  2. Direct relevance to arrhythmia or heartbeat classification tasks.
  3. Provides either dataset provenance (e.g., PhysioNet/MIT-BIH) or state-of-the-art deep learning methodology applicable to our pipeline.
- **Chosen References:**
  - Goldberger et al. (2000) describing PhysioNet resources (Datasets section).
  - Hannun et al. (2019) reporting cardiologist-level arrhythmia detection with deep neural networks (Methods section).
  - Kachuee et al. (2018) introducing transferable representations for ECG heartbeat classification (Methods section).
- **Exclusions:**
  - Preprints lacking peer review.
  - Studies focused solely on hardware sensor design without classification results.
- **Next Steps:** Integrate citations into both journal bibliography files and ensure manuscript outline references align with these sources.
