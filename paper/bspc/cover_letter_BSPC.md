# Cover Letter (BSPC)

Dear Editor-in-Chief,

Please find our manuscript entitled **"Reproducible ECG Heartbeat Classification under AAMI Five-Class Taxonomy using a Compact CNN+Conformer with Wavelet Scalograms"** submitted to *Biomedical Signal Processing and Control*.

**Fit to journal** — The work lies squarely within BSPC’s scope on biomedical signal processing and clinically-oriented applications. We target heartbeat classification under the AAMI five-class mapping on MIT–BIH with a compact time–frequency pipeline (Morlet CWT scalograms + CNN+Conformer).

**Reproducibility** — All figures/tables are derived from artifacts in a public repository, pinned to commit `384b316cf65a47b9d66035e5a868f970e89525dc`, ensuring exact reproducibility without retraining.

**What is new** — (i) A lightweight Conformer-based classifier for ECG scalograms; (ii) an entirely artifact-driven evaluation (leaderboard across runs, per-class analysis, ROC/PR emphases); (iii) a submission pack that copies figures from the repo and rebuilds derived plots from classification reports.

**Why it matters** — The pipeline is robust, simple to deploy, and transparent. It addresses typical pain points (class imbalance; reproducibility) and can serve as a strong baseline for future clinical and embedded deployments.

We confirm that the manuscript is original, not under consideration elsewhere, and that all authors have approved the submission. We declare no competing interests.

Sincerely,
