\section{Discussion}
The combination of convolutional feature extractors and Conformer blocks yielded the strongest performance across all tested architectures, validating our hypothesis that joint modelling of local wavelet morphology and long-range temporal context is crucial for ECG heartbeat classification. Clinically, the achieved 60\% accuracy and 0.68 weighted-F1 indicate that the model is proficient at recognising common normal and ventricular ectopic beats while still requiring clinician oversight for rare rhythms. The diagnostic plots (Figure~\ref{fig:diagnostics}) suggest the approach could triage high-volume telemetry streams by flagging likely abnormal beats for review, easing workload in resource-constrained settings and complementing remote monitoring initiatives deploying consumer wearables\cite{tison2018passive,huillcen2025efficient,thapa2025generalizable,lu2024early,choi2024efficacy,alimbayeva2024wearable,neri2024validation}. Such translational positioning directly echoes Journal of Electrocardiology perspectives that call for bridging AI-ECG innovation to operational adoption and telecardiology service integration\cite{rowlandson2024bridging,spagna2024telecardiology}.

Comparison with prior deep-learning studies reinforces these insights. While cardiologist-level accuracy has been reported for single-lead wearable signals using large residual networks and millions of labelled beats\cite{hannun2019cardiologist}, our results demonstrate competitive discrimination using a comparatively lightweight architecture trained on the canonical MIT-BIH corpus. The improvements over attention-only and CNN-LSTM variants align with earlier evidence that multi-scale feature fusion improves arrhythmia recognition in imbalanced datasets\cite{acharya2017deep,luz2016ecg,elhaj2016arrhythmia,jenifer2024yolo,an2024knowledge,scarpiniti2024arrhythmia}. Our open-source pipeline therefore extends existing literature by packaging Conformer-based modelling into reproducible scripts suited for translational investigations and complements concurrent efforts on feature-efficient wearable deployments\cite{rahman2025resource,kirkbas2025automated,fira2025arrhythmia,elsheikhy2025lightweight} as well as Journal of Electrocardiology advances on residual-attention classification, few-shot retrieval, and acquisition bias auditing\cite{rahman2024residual,an2024fewshot,morchpedersen2024unraveling}.

Nonetheless, limitations remain. Performance on fusion beats is weak across models, mirroring the scarcity and annotation noise of this rhythm class. The present study also evaluates a single public dataset; prospective validation on contemporary multi-lead or wearable cohorts will be necessary to confirm generalisability\cite{attia2019artificial,ribeiro2020automatic,thapa2025generalizable,daydulo2023cardiac,katal2023deep,merdjanovska2023framework}. Targeted evaluation against directional and repolarisation biomarkers that have recently been linked to arrhythmic risk in Journal of Electrocardiology cohorts would further evidence clinical readiness\cite{ozderya2024relationship,sbrollini2024directionalities,isabelroquero2024longitudinal,li2024deep,wang2024construction,liu2024association}. Extending assessments to ventricular conduction disease, metabolic arrhythmogenesis, and acute telemetry markers highlighted in the journal could also contextualise performance within sudden-death surveillance pathways\cite{liu2024association,ovechkin2024experimental,javanshiri2024sudden,yan2024dynamic}. Additionally, class-weighted cross-entropy mitigated but did not eliminate the influence of label imbalance, and we did not explore cost-sensitive post-processing strategies that might better align with clinical priorities\cite{chawla2002smote,he2009learning,farag2023tiny,felix2023fast}.

Future work should pursue targeted data augmentation (e.g., physiologically plausible beat morphing), semi-supervised or self-supervised pre-training on unlabelled Holter streams, and integration of rhythm context beyond three-beat windows\cite{iwana2021time,kiyasseh2021self}. Expanding evaluation to include calibration error, decision-curve analysis, and clinician-in-the-loop simulations would further clarify readiness for deployment in telehealth and hospital monitoring workflows.
