Aims and scope
==============

Aims and scope
--------------

_BioMedical Engineering OnLine_ is an open access, peer-reviewed journal that is dedicated to publishing research in all areas of biomedical engineering.

_BioMedical Engineering OnLine_ is aimed at readers and authors throughout the world, with an interest in using tools of the physical and data sciences and techniques in engineering to understand and solve problems in the biological and medical sciences. 

 BioMedical Engineering OnLine does not consider papers that contain only simulation data (no real patient data), that work with only publicly available data (e.g. Physionet, TCGA), studies containing health controls, and preliminary design results. 

 Topical areas include, but are not limited to:

Bioinformatics 

 Bioinstrumentation 

 Biomechanics 

 Biomedical Devices & Instrumentation 

 Biomedical Signal Processing 

 Healthcare Information Systems 

 Human Dynamics 

 Neural Engineering 

 Rehabilitation Engineering 

 Biomaterials 

 Biomedical Imaging & Image Processing 

 BioMEMS and On-Chip Devices 

 Bio-Micro/Nano Technologies 

 Biomolecular Engineering 

 Biosensors 

 Cardiovascular Systems Engineering 

 Cellular Engineering 

 Clinical Engineering 

 Computational Biology 

 Drug Delivery Technologies 

 Modeling Methodologies 

 Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology in Biomedicine 

 Respiratory Systems Engineering 

 Robotics in Medicine 

 Systems and Synthetic Biology 

 Systems Biology 

 Telemedicine/Smartphone Applications in Medicine 

 Therapeutic Systems, Devices and Technologies 

 Tissue Engineering

This publication promotes the rapid and free accessibility of articles for biomedical engineering researchers everywhere, who are linked together by their various research interests and their values in promoting benefits to all of humanity.
